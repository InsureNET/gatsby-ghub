I'm attempting to build a starter template for Gatsby. It is geared towards users that want to build web apps with some areas for static content.

To show the proof of concept, I created a section where I statically render resumes for users based off of their github profile. Then in the App section, I used netlify to sign up/manage users, and Apollo client for on demand gql queries to generate resumes.
