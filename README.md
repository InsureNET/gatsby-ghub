## Make Web Apps with Dyanmic and Static Content Using Gatsby

To show the proof of concept, I created a section where I statically render resumes for users based off of their github profile. Then in the App section, I used netlify to sign up/manage users, and Apollo client for on demand gql queries to generate resumes.

## How to start

Thank you to the [Gatsby](https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs?lang=en) and [@swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx) for idea and skeleton app. My starter is a fork of https://github.com/sw-yx/jamstack-hackathon-starter which shows how to use Netlify Identity and Netlify Functions with Gatsby.
